- Only direct (type and namespace) alias reflection.
- Access to private class members:
  - Getting lists of members
    - Additional parameter to `get_data_members`, `get_member_types`, ...
    - Additional operation allowing access to private members in a sequence:
      - `include_nonpublic_m<get_data_members_m<reflexpr(...)>>`
  - Getting back to the base-level from a metaobject.
    - Additional parameter to `get_pointer`,`get_reflected_type`, ...
    - Additional parameter to `(un)reflexpr`?
    - Additional operation explicitly allowing access?
      - meta::Accessible concept ?
      - `is_publicly_accessible` operation on meta::Reversible?
      - `get_pointer_v<access_nonpublic_m<Metaobject>>`

- Concept for user-defined declarations (as opposed to built-ins, the global
  scope, specifiers, etc.)
  - Only MOs satisfying this concept would have the source location operations
    - `get_source_file`
    - `get_source_line`
    - `get_source_column`
  - meta::Declared?
  - meta::UserDeclared?
  - meta::UserDefined?
  - Or just a new operation `meta::is_user_defined` or `meta::has_declaration`

- Rename the reverse variant of `reflexpr` to `unreflexpr`? - improves
  greppability, helps to distinguish reflection from reverse reflection.
  Also simplifies the implementation, and can be used for identifier generation.

- Will we need separate unrefltype and unreflexpr ?
- Or something to disambiguate unreflexpr especially in dependent contexts
  - Something like unreflexpr(typename, ...), unreflexpr(namespace, ...), ...?

- Mention why we require the reflexpr header (can help implementations)

- Examples for simple use cases and possible simplified interfaces
  - get full type name (including formatting options for whitespaces, const,...)

Additional nice to have features:

- Variadic composition
- Construction of Metaobjects without reflection?
  - or modification of existing Metaobjects ?
  - Motivation: replace the type of a reflected variable with a typedef
  - replace_type_m<reflexpr(my_var), reflexpr(std::size_t)>
  - would loose the reversibility capability?

- Generalized *lazy* typelists to replace metaobject sequences
  - `get_size`
  - `get_element`
  - `unpack_typelist`
  - User-defined construction of such typelists:
    - `make_typelist<T...>` ?
  - we technically can do just with MoSeqs in reflection.

- Strong typedefs.
  - Conversions
