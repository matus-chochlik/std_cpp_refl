\section{Revision history}

\subsection{P0385R0}

This is the initial revision of the design paper accompanying the P0194 papers.

\subsection{P0385R1 -- current revision}

This revision brings the following updates reflecting\footnote{Pun not intended}
the changes made in the P0194R2 paper.

\begin{itemize}
\item Based on the feedback from Oulu, the specification of typedef and
type alias reflection has been simplified. We no longer require reflection
to be aware of the whole chain of type aliases especially not in the context
of templates, each type alias only references the underlying type with unique
identity at the base level.
\item Unlike in the previous revision it is now possible to create variables
with {\em metaobject} types.
\item Section~\ref{fac-for-each} describing the \verb@for_each@ function
planned to be included in future revisions has been revised.
\item The {\em reverse reflection operator} has been renamed to \verb@unreflexpr@.
\item The {\em identifier-generating operator} has been renamed to \verb@idreflexpr@.
\item The mechanism for enumerating public-only vs. all (including non-public ones)
class members has been changed. Now the \say{basic} operations like
\verb@get_data_members@, \verb@get_member_types@, etc.
return all members, and the \verb@get_public_data_members@,
\verb@get_public_member_types@, return only the public class members.
\item All examples have been revised and extended according to the changes listed above.
\item New examples have been added to section~\ref{design-prefs} describing
the design considerations.
\item A description of the implementation has been added (section~\ref{implementation}).
\item A brief introduction to the {\em Mirror reflection utilities} has been added
(section~\ref{mirror-lib}).
\end{itemize}
