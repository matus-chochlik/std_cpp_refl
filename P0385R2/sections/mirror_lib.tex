\section{The Mirror reflection utilities}
\label{mirror-lib}

In order to show the usability of the proposed reflection facility, we have
implemented a set of higher level reflection utilities and examples built
on top of it. The source code repository can be found
in~\cite{Chochlik-Mirror-new-repo} and the documentation also including
the build-instructions is in~\cite{Chochlik-Mirror-new-doc}.
