\subsection{Future extensions of the reflection operator}
\label{fut-reflexpr}

Besides the primary function of the \verb@reflexpr@ operator -- reflecting,
base-level declarations, there are several potential additional uses for it,
or for related operators like (\verb@unreflexpr@ and \verb@idreflexpr@),
some of which are also mentioned in other sections. These are briefly reiterated
here:

\begin{itemize}
\item context-dependent reflection, described in section
	\ref{context-dependent-reflection},
\item reverse reflection, described in section \ref{fut-reverse-reflection},
\item generating identifiers, described in section \ref{fut-ident-formatting},
\item turning a \verb@constexpr@ metaobject unique-identifier back
	to the metaobject type as described in section \ref{fut-metaobject-uid}.
\end{itemize}
